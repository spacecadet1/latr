# Latr

Latr is small utility application to automate simple Pandoc and latexdiff functions so that I can convert my LaTex manuscripts to Word and show changes in a pdf output. It's handy for those (like myself) who make typos in the command line. The tool was originally a MacOS Objective-C application, and I quickly rewrote in QT and C++ for cross-platform distribution. You need to have Pandoc and LaTex already installed on your machine in order for this program to be used.
